# Xmas Tip

I tried to find a christmas theme for this but I couldn't think of one so.. deal with it.

Firstly, [how _not_ to gift sustainably](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Crystal-Art-Collect-Moments-Not-Things-Wrapped-Canvas-Print-Wall-Art-Decor/750547279), thanks to Walmart, who knew they had such a delicious sense of irony!

Now, I'm going to give you a recipe. It's one of my favourites becuase its

- Cheap as hell
- Simple
- Nutrious
- and Delicous!
- (also vegan) 

It only has five ingredients, and that's counting salt and water! So, here's my recipe for 

## Tarka Dhal, the simplest and best dhal

### Ingredients

- 1 cup red lentils
- 3-4 large cloves of garlic
- ~6 tblsp cooking oil
- 2-5 cups of water, there's quite a lot of leeway with the amount of water depnding on how runny you like your dhal. I like mine runny.
- 2-3 tsp salt (go on - use 3)

### Method

1. Set the water to boil in a kettle
2. Crush (with the side of your knife) and very roughly chop the garlic
3. Put a large, heavy pot on the stove on a high heat, make sure to use one that has a lid
4. Pour oil into the pot until the pool touches the sides all around - thats the right amount
5. Add the garlic to the pot
6. Turn your hood extractor fan onto full
7. Fry the hell out of the garlic. Keep frying it on high heat until it's dark brown to black and slightly smoking
8. Turn the heat to low and add the lentils to the pot, keep stirring them until they change to a lighter orange
9. Slowly and carefully, holding the kettle at arms length, pour the hot water into the pot. Expect a lot of bubbling and steam, but it should calm down once you've added all the water.
10. Add the salt
11. Put the lid on the pot and simmer, stirring occasionally for about 25 minutes or until all the lentils have disintegrated.

Boom! Enjoy it as a soup, as a dhal alongside a curry or on its own with rice and pickle. If you make it quite runny you can also use it as a gravy substitute, so that's kind of a christmas connection!
